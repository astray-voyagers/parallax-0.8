  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Definition</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;">By definition, a simulation is an imitation. So simulation games are games that imitate a real-life situation. Another way to think about it is that simulation games attempt to recreate a past event. But games don't always stick to that definition, sometimes they border on fantasy or potential future situations.


Within the simulation games genre, there are sub-genres. Because of the variety of simulation games, there is probably at least one sub-genre that you may enjoy, </p>

      <h4 style="text-align:center; color:white;">Sub-Genre</h4>
       <div class="BoxT1"><h3>Life<p>Life simulations directly imitate life itself, whether it be daily life or playing god. This is a great genre that has grown drastically over the last few years. Popular games of this type include "The Sims 2" and "Black and White 2."</p> </h3></div>
       <div class="BoxT1"><h3>City Building<p>In city building games, you design the layout, make laws, collect taxes, and try to build your city. Gameplay varies from different game to game, but the premise is the same, to develop a successful city.</p> </h3></div>
       <div class="BoxT1"><h3>Flight<p>Flight sims give you the chance to be a pilot of just about any plane or helicopter you've wanted to fly. The genre of flight simulations has come so far over the last few years. The graphics are intense, there are many playing options, and the realism keeps flight sim fans going back for more.</p> </h3></div>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">History Of Simulation</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;">In the mid 1980s, Code masters and the Oliver Twins released a number of games with "Simulator" in the title, including BMX Simulator (1986), Grand Prix Simulator (1986), and Pro Boxing Simulator (1988). Richard and David Darling of Code masters were inspired by Concertmaster's best-selling games, which were based on real sports such as football and BMX racing, which had a pre-existing popularity. In a parody of the established "simulator" cliche, Your Sinclair released a game titled Advanced Lawnmower Simulator in 1988.

While many credit simulation games beginning with Will Wright and SimCity in 1989, the true progenitor of the genre was Fortune Builder, released in 1984 for ColecoVision. Games such as SimLife and SimEarth were subsequently created and are capable of teaching players the basics of genetics and global ecosystems.

A study of adolescents who played SimCity 2000 found that those players had a greater appreciation and expectation of their government officials after playing.</p>
